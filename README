NAME

    LWPx::UserAgent::Cached - Subclass of LWP::UserAgent that caches HTTP
    GET requests

VERSION

    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS

        use LWPx::UserAgent::Cached;
        use CHI;
    
        my $ua = LWPx::UserAgent::Cached->new(
            cache => CHI->new(
                driver => 'File', root_dir => '/tmp/cache', expires_in => '1d',
            ),
        );
        $ua->get('http://www.perl.org/');

DESCRIPTION

    This module borrows the caching logic from WWW::Mechanize::Cached but
    without inheriting from WWW::Mechanize; instead it is just a direct
    subclass of LWP::UserAgent.

ATTRIBUTES

 cache

    Settable at construction, defaults to using CHI::Driver::RawMemory with
    an instance-specific hash datastore and a namespace with the current
    package name. You can use your own caching object here as long as it
    has get and set methods.

 is_cached

    Read-only accessor that indicates if the current request is cached or
    not.

 cache_undef_content_length

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should cache content even if the HTTP Content-Length header is missing
    or undefined. Defaults to false.

 cache_zero_content_length

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should cache content even if the HTTP Content-Length header is zero.
    Defaults to false.

 cache_mismatch_content_length

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should cache content even if the length of the data does not match the
    HTTP Content-Length header. Defaults to true.

 ref_in_cache_key

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should store the HTTP referrer in the cache key. Defaults to false.

 positive_cache

    Settable at construction or anytime thereafter, indicates whether we
    should only cache positive responses (HTTP response codes from 200 to
    300 inclusive) or cache everything. Defaults to true.

HANDLERS

    This module works by adding request_send and response_done handlers
    method that run on successful HTTP GET requests. If you need to modify
    or remove these handlers you may use LWP::UserAgent's handlers method.
